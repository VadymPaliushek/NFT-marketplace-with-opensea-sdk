# NFT marketplace demo for Ali

## Opensea Marketplace Clone Website:

We would like a website that very closely resembles Opensea.
The SDK will allow almost a perfect copy of Opensea.

https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-js/

The functions should be very similar and specially we would require:

-multiple sellers, multiple buyers
-Account creation using a web3 crypto wallet such as Metamask
-Sellers should be able to create collections using NFT using ERC-1155 standard- gasless transactions (again Opensea SDK features this tool)
-Sellers should be able to create and manage their collections like in Opensea.
-The homepage should have some featured collections from sellers, trending collections and new collections.
-Users should be able to search using filters such as
  * Recently Listed
  * Highest Price
  * Recently created
  * Highest Last Sale
  * Expiring Soon
  * Oldest
  * Lowest Price
  * Most Views
  
And finally as we discussed, once a buyer buys the NFT the web3 wallet pays the seller automatically just like Opensea. Payments fully managed by the wallets.

About 25 days.
